              <p>“Women who perhaps suffered most in this period were, ironically, those like the Queen who did not wish to marry. Tudor society did not have many avenues open to single women and, following the Reformation, those avenues were even less. Before, women were able to become nuns and look forward to a rewarding life in convents, perhaps be a Mother Superior one day. But with the Reformation, the convents were closed. Wealthy single women (heiresses of property) could look forward to being mistress of their estates and wield the power in the community this would bring, but for poor women, the only long-term “career” really open to them was domestic service. It was not surprising, therefore, that most women married. Marriage was seen as the desirable state for both men and women, and single women were sometimes looked upon with suspicion. It was mainly single women who were accused of being witches by their neighbours.”</p>

              <p>Unmarried women were rounded up and imprisoned in an effort to control women’s productive and reproductive rights, in between World Wars I and II. Women’s roles in society were starting to diversify, and this was an effort to reassert control. In order to be released, a man would have to come and pay for the right to marry her. This affected women who could not find a man to marry and women who did not want to marry due to either economic factors, her own autonomy, or the simple desire not to marry. </p>

              <p>"Stigmatized singles and deemed them abnormal (marriage is elevated and the only “normal” path to intimacy). Single men and women are “extra”; psychiatry shapes this picture of singles. In a survey taken in 1957, eighty percent of Americans believed that people who preferred to remain single were “sick,” “neurotic,” or “immoral.” Unmarried women were deemed suspect, as they could steal away a husband at any time. And unwed men were seen as “narcissistic, deviant, and pathological." </p>

                    <p>“If heterosexuality is one of the ways in which men’s power over women is maintained, then lesbianism is or can be a threat to that power. This aspect of resistance involves all women outside of heterosexuality, including celibate or unmarried women. Like lesbians, they are all women who are not subject to men’s social and sexual power through a personal relationship. Thus, although attacks were made on unmarried women teachers primarily as spinsters rather than as lesbians, it will be argued that they were maligned for being outside heterosexuality.”

              <p>“While emotional problems are common among single men, a number of unwed men adjust completely to life without women and find a thoroughly satisfying existence alone. Some of these seem to have found fulfillment in their working life exclusively. Examples can be found in every field. Other men find a sense of completion by rounding out their business lives with an engrossing hobby, often in the sports field…</p>
              <p>However well he may adjust to his lonely life, the single man suffers disabilities that seem to be traceable directly to his bachelorhood. Unwed men are much less healthy than their married brothers. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company studies show that more than four times as many unattached men as married men (ages 20–74) die of tuberculosis. At ages 20–44, five to six times as many unmarried men as husbands die of influenza and pneumonia. Prior to mid-life, nine divorced men are victims of cirrhosis of the liver to each married man killed by that disease.”</p>
